# BLAKE2

This is the reference source code package of BLAKE2, which includes

* `ref/`: C implementations of BLAKE2b, BLAKE2bp, BLAKE2s, BLAKE2sp,
  aimed at portability and simplicity.

* `sse/`: C implementations of BLAKE2b, BLAKE2bp, BLAKE2s, BLAKE2sp,
  optimized for speed on CPUs supporting SSE2, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, or
  XOP.

* `neon/`: Implementations of BLAKE2{s,b} using the NEON/ASIMD ARM instruction set.

* `power8/`: Implementations of BLAKE2{s,b} for POWER8, using the VSX and Altivec extensions.

* `csharp/`: C# implementation of BLAKE2b.

* `b2sum/`: Command line utility to hash files, based on the `sse/`
  implementations.

* `bench/`: Benchmark tool to measure cycles-per-byte speeds and produce
  graphs copyright.
